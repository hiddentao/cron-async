# cron-async

Javascript library for execute tasks on a schedule, using cron syntax, with async/await support. It is inspired by [node-cron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron).

It's smart at handling async jobs. All executions are wrapped in a `try-catch` clause and errors are caught and logged. It also waits until the current iteration of 
a job has finished executing before starting the next iteration, regardless of the jobs's schedule.

Features:

* Works inÂ both Node.js and Browsers.
* Performant: uses a single interval timer for all created jobs.
* Customizable logger.
* Typesript support / fully typed.
* Auto-generated [documentation](https://hiddentao.github.io/cron-async).

## Installation

* NPM: `npm i cron-async`
* Yarn: `yarn add cron-async`
* PNPM: `pnpm add cron-async`
